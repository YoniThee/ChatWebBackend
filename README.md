### connect to sqlServer
in your microsoft sqlServer app create a new DB
(at the objectExplorer click right on "Database" folder under your the sql server and choose "new DataBase")

now from visual studio after your repo is up go to server explorer and choose connect to dataBase
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd44bb1-2082-4a35-8333-61cfc0e0a183)
here enter your server name and select the DB that you created at the previues step.

now test the connection and make sure is working sueccessfully.

now in your project there is 2 places that you need to change according your serverName and DB name.

in appSetting file there is string
```
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=server-name;Database=my-DB-name;Encrypt=false;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
},
```

here change the Server and Datbase to your correct name

and also in chatDbContext file 
```
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=server-name;Database=my-DB-name;Encrypt=false;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;");

}
```

change according yours.

now you need to create the tables in your DB, you can do it manually or using this commands
go to packege meneger terminal and run:

```
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore

Add-Migration InitialCreate

Update-Database

```

make sure that you have all the necessary tables and that each is defined as well including the correct Keys!
